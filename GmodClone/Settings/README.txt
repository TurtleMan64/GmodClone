How to configure your controller:

The game always uses the ControllerConfig.ini to map buttons and axis. The 
other ControllerConfig files (like ControllerConfigXbox360.ini) are premade 
config files for specific controllers that you can copy+paste into 
ControllerConfig.ini. These still aren't guarenteed to be mapped to your 
controller perfectly though, as there are many things that can change how your 
controller is mapped.

If you need to map buttons for your controller, you can use the controller 
input viewer in Control Panel (also accessible by typing joy.cpl into the 
start menu) to see which buttons are which index. Keep in mind, they usually 
start at index 1 in the viewer, and ControllerConfig.ini starts at index 0.
